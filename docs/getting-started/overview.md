## Installing the Documentation

In order for Xceed's product documentation to be installed correctly, you must ensure that local help will be accessed before online help. To do this, launch the Help Library Manager from Visual Studio (`Help\Manage Help Settings` menu), click on "Choose online or local help", and then select "I want to use local help" as your preferred help experience.

If you install Xceed's components without first selecting "I want to use local help", you will encounter a 404 "page not found" error when you attempt to access the product documentation. To correct the problem after having installed Xceed's products, follow the procedure described above to select local help, and then import the required MSHA files (located in the installation folder under "Documentation") manually into the Help Viewer.
