# SSL

SSL and TLS (SSL 3.1) are protocols layered above connection protocols (such as TCP/IP) but beneath application protocols (such as FTP) that provide encrypted, authenticated communications between a client and a server. 

Xceed FTP for .NET version 2.0 and up supports SSL version 3.0 and 3.1 (TLS).
