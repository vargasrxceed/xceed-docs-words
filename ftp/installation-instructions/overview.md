# Installation instructions

The Xceed Component Installer will copy all the necessary files into the product's installation folder (usually in `<InstallDir>Xceed Components\Bin\.NET` and `<InstallDir>Xceed Components\Bin\.NET Compact Framework`) and place a copy of all the assemblies in the global assembly cache (the latter step will not occur for the assemblies built for .NET 4 and Xamarin). The only thing left to do in order to begin using Xceed's products is to add the assemblies to your project and license them for runtime use.
